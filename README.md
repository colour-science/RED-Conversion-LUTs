## Why?

RED doesn't provide a way to convert post-debayered (DPX, ProRes, etc.) footage from REDlogFilm to the various REDgamma versions. If your post workflow is not R3D-centric or has VFX shots but you still want to view the footage in REDgamma spaces, these LUTs should help tremendously. In essence, these LUTs will match (very closely) to what was viewed on set, assuming you were viewing in a REDgamma space and have a REDlogFilm post workflow.

## Want these in another format?

[Lattice](lattice.videovillage.co) can do that.
